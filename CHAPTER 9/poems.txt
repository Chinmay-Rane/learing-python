Twinklsdfe, twinksdfle, diamond ore,
How I wonder what’s in store!
Deep inside the caves so high,
Glowing bright for all who try.

When the torches fade away,
Mobs come out to hunt and play,
Creepers hiss and Endermen stare,
Diamonds shine—they’re always rare.

Twinksdfle, twinksdfle, diamond ore,
Every miner’s dream and more!
